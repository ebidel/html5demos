[![Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-46812528-1/ebidel/html5demos/README)](https://github.com/igrigorik/ga-beacon)

This repository contains all my demos from http://html5-demos.appspot.com/

If you would like to download a particular demo, say the hangouts demo project, instead of downloading the entire repo 500MB+, instead you can just run:

```
svn export https://github.com/ebidel/html5demos/trunk/html5-demos.appspot.com/static/webcomponents-bdconf/demos/components/hangouts
```
